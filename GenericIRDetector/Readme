This directory is used to contain all of the files related to the training of the IRFIS (InfraRed Fever Indicator System)  Generic IR Detector which is the 
retraining of a COCO trained RGB General Object Detecor with EfficientDet D0 architecture.   The Generic IR Detector is trained with a modified version (no small people)
of the IR image ADAS dataset published by FLIR.   Specifically small detections of people are removed as we have much lower resoltion with our FLIR ONE PRO camera than
the resolution of the ADAS dataset.   ALSO, the ADAS dataset has only 4 of the COCO classes (person, dog, car, bicycle)

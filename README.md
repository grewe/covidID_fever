IR Fever is a sub project of Covid ID dealing with Fever detection using IR imagery with computer vision and machine learning.

Note: installing the object detection API locally on windows is more involved than the colab version
On Colab, you can simply copy the first two cells from [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLqFKVV94wm-lglFq_0kGo2ciM0kecWD#scrollTo=fF8ysCfYKgTP&uniqifier=1)

On Linux locally, you can do the same, so ideally run from a Linux environment (this goes for all cutting-edge ML development)

If you only have windows locally, you can either [install a Linux partition](https://itsfoss.com/guide-install-linux-mint-16-dual-boot-windows/) (recommended) or google solutions if the Unix commands do not work. When these notebooks were made, the Object Detection API for TensorFlow2 was only weeks old, and documentation was scarce. Hopefully, there are better tutorials out there for isntalling TensorFlow2 Object Detection API on Windows now!
